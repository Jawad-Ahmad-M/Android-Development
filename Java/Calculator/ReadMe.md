# Morse Code Encryptor & Decryptor Android App

This Android application provides a seamless and intuitive way to convert between plain text and Morse code. Designed for both beginners and enthusiasts, the app supports full **encryption** of text into Morse code and **decryption** of Morse code back into readable text. Users can also customize the Morse code symbols, replacing the traditional dot (`.`) and dash (`-`) characters with any symbols they prefer.

## Features

- **Text Encryption to Morse Code:**  
  Convert any input text — including letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and common punctuation — into the internationally recognized Morse code format. Each character is translated into a sequence of dots and dashes.

- **Morse Code Decryption to Text:**  
  Decode Morse code sequences back into human-readable text. The app accurately interprets standard Morse code symbols and converts them to the corresponding alphabet, digits, or punctuation.

- **Customizable Dot and Dash Symbols:**  
  The app allows users to replace the default dot (`.`) and dash (`-`) characters with custom symbols or characters. This feature lets users personalize Morse code output or adapt the code for special use cases.

- **Clipboard Integration:**  
  Easily copy the encrypted or decrypted results to the system clipboard with a single button tap, enabling quick sharing or use in other applications.

- **Simple and User-Friendly Interface:**  
  The app offers a clean and intuitive UI with separate screens for encryption and decryption, clear input fields, and easily accessible buttons to set defaults, save custom symbols, perform conversions, and navigate between activities.

## Supported Characters

The app supports the complete Morse code standard set for:

- **Alphabets:** a–z (case-insensitive)
- **Digits:** 0–9
- **Special Characters:**  
  `. , ? ' ! / ( ) & : ; = + - _ " $ @`
- **Spaces:** Represented as `/` in Morse code, allowing clear separation between words.

## How to Use the App

1. **Encryption:**
   - Enter your desired text into the input field on the Encryption screen.
   - Optionally, customize the dot and dash symbols by entering new characters and saving them.
   - Press the **Encrypt** button to convert the text into Morse code.
   - View the resulting Morse code in the output area.
   - Use the **Copy to Clipboard** button to copy the Morse code for sharing or pasting elsewhere.

2. **Decryption:**
   - Switch to the Decryption screen using the navigation button.
   - Enter Morse code sequences in the input field. Use spaces to separate individual Morse characters and slashes (`/`) for spaces between words.
   - Customize the dot and dash symbols if different from defaults.
   - Tap **Decrypt** to translate the Morse code back into text.
   - View the decoded message in the output area.
   - Copy the result to the clipboard if needed.

3. **Managing Symbols:**
   - Use the **Set Defaults** button to reset dot and dash symbols to the standard `.` and `-`.
   - Enter your preferred symbols in the input fields and save them to personalize encoding and decoding.
